This is a collection of my knowledge system built on the [Zettelkasten method](https://Zettelkasten.de/) (also known as the slipbox) is a method used extensively by [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann) for which he used to aid him in writing over 70 books.

The goal is to have notes that are as atomic as possible - the notes have been written using the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) text editor.

#### Connect Notes

Notes can be connected using an idea compass for an _atomic idea `X`_

- Where does _`X`_ come from?
- Where does _`X`_ lead?
- What's opposite of _`X`_?
- What's similar to _`X`_?
