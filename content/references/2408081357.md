## The Golang Scheduler (Blog)

- A **scheduler** is a program that decides which process should be executed next

- The **Golang Scheduler** is used to schedule go routines to the kernel-space threads
- Scheduler is responsible for adding and removing go routines from a runqueue
- The priority of rhe runqueue is FIFO

- A **mutex** is a lock that is used to synchronise access to a shared resource
  - The runqueue acts as a shared resource
- A mutex ensures that only one kernel thread can access the run queue at a time
- If a thread's runqueue is full, then the goroutine will be added to the global runqueue

- <u>What</u> is **work starvation**?

- **Preemption** is the ability of a scheduler to preempt (stop) a goroutine running for more than 10ms and execute another goroutine
- Preempted goroutines are added to the global runqueue (also a FIFO queue)

- When a kernel thread is blocked by a system call, the goroutines will go to another thread
