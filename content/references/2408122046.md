- Goroutines are the most basic unit of concurrent execution

- Amdahl's law explains that the effect of parallelisation depends on how much of the process is sequential
  - Gustafson's law argues that the size of a problem changes when you have access to more resources
  - As the problem size increases, generally, the non-parallel portion of the problem remains constant allowing the problem to scale linearly with more parallel resources

## Interrupts

- An _interrupt_ is used to stop the current execution and notify the system of a particular event
- Interrupts are handled by the _interrupt controller_
- The interrupt controller handles interrupts coming from multiple devices and notifies the CPU to stop the current job (and save the job's context)
  - A hardware clock can also interrupt the current execution to ensure all jobs in the run queue are given a chance to execute
- The OS scheduler decides which job to do execute from the run queue
- Interrupts can be expensive as it involves _context switching_ (saving the current job state and then loading the new job from the run queue)
  - The job state is called the _process context block_, which stores the CPU register, program counter (also the instruction pointer) and information about the memory

## Processes

- A process represents a program running on the OS
- A thread is a construct within the process that's lightweight and aids concurrency

- `fork()` is a UNIX system call used to create a copy of an existing process
- After `fork()` is run, the child process can determine to keep or clear the copied resources
- Each process (parent and child) can determine what instructions to run after `fork()` is called (based on the return value of `fork()`)
- Creating processes can be expensive as it consumes more memory and uses more CPU cycles
