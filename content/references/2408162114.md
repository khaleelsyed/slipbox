- When engineering a product, always build the core technology first
- Customers derive the most value from the core features
- Ask yourself what part of the product is core?
- What part of the product is most riskiest to build?
- What features already exist in other products and what's novel?

- When building a feature list, always ask yourself how a requested feature will solve a customers pain point
- Always try and think what the skateboard version of the product might be (as opposed to engineering a car)

- Prioritise functionality over perfectionism - start-ups should be more concerned about product-market fit rather than scalability or perfect practises
