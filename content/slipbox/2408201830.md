The global interpreter lock in python locks the interpreter to ensure only one concurrent process runs at a time - parallel computation is not possible (this may be toggled in Python 3.13 or later). 

While the lock can be disabled, it helps improve the single thread performance. As only 1 thread can be executed at a time, this helps to reduce [race conditions](references/2408091746), memory corruption and aids [garbage collection](slipbox/2408201849).
