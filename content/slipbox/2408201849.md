There are three ways you can manage memory usage in the source code:

1. Manual Memory Management
2. Reference Counting
3. Garbage collection

- Manual memory management involves calling functions that allocate/free memory to variables
  - Can cause issues if try to free memory that isn't allocated (may attempt to free memory used by another program)
  - Problems may occur if you forget to free memory after it's no longer needed (memory leaks can occur)
- Reference counting involves counting the number of times a variable is used to determine understand when a variable is safe to be freed
  - Can't deal with loops
  - May sometimes cause memory leaks to occur

## Garbage Collection

- Garbage collection is a form of memory management generally consists of 3 stages

  1.  Mark
  2.  Reachability Check
  3.  Sweep unreachable memory

- Mark all memory that is allocated by the program
- Check that all the marked memory can be reachable
  - Ensure to check loops and memory is that is referenced indirectly
- Sweep (deallocate) all unreachable memory
